I had created a dashboard of HR(Human Resource) Analytical Report on Power Bi in which I have discussed following fields:
▶ Firstly,the data of overall employees have been shown which is telling total Employees of the company , Current Employees who are working here , Ex Employees , Average Age of The Employees.
▶ Secondly,Each image is showing the data of different Education level i.e Associate Degree , High School , Bachelor's Degree , Master's Degree.
